# excel_project
In this project. I worked with MS Excel using a dataset called Bike Purchase Data. Here I performed the following approaches to process as well as visualize the data:

* Created a new worksheet and pasted the dataset. I usually prefer to work on my own worksheet. It allows me not to change the main dataset and it's safe.
* Then I renamed the column values of the column called Gender to "Male" and "Female" from "M" and "F"
* Also, I renamed the column values of the column called Marital Status to "Married" and "Single" from "M" and "S"
* Then I created a new column called Age Brackets where I simply labeled the age from the Age column considering a few age ranges(Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) using Nested IF statement
* Then I created 3 different Pivot Tables and Visualizations using those Pivot Tables
* Last but not least, I created a dashboard where I showcase the visualizations I created using the Pivot Tables
* In the dashboard, I also added a few filter options (e.g. filter with respect to the marital status)

## The following is the screenshot of the dashboard that I created in this project:

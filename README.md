# excel_project
In this project. I worked with MS Excel and used a dataset called Bike Purchase Data. I performed the following approaches to process the data as well as visualize data:

- Created a new worksheet and pasted the dataset. I usually prefer to work on my own worksheet. It allows me not to change the main dataset and it's safe.
- Then I renamed the column values of the column called Gender to "Male" and "Female" from "M" and "F"
- Also, I renamed the column values of the column called Marital Status to "Married" and "Single" from "M" and "S"
- Then I created a new column called Age Brackets where I simply labeled the age from the Age column considering a few age ranges(Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) using Nested IF statement
- Then I created 3 different Pivot Tables and Visualizations using those Pivot Tables
- Last but not least, I created a dashboard where I showcase the visualizations I created using the Pivot Tables
- In the dashboard, I also added a few filter options (e.g. filter with respect to the marital status)
